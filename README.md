## Flask Web app tutorial test
----

A simple Flask web application tutorial - a first try-out.

In this tutorial I will also be attempting to utilize a Docker container, not
part of the Flask tut, but guidance taken from other sources.

Some of the code has departed a little from the tutorial as I try to
make it a bit 'individual'.

In addintion to the tutorial material, I will be also try to
containerize this app - Docker. This part has as yet not been added.
