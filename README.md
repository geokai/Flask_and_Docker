Flask Web app tutorial test
---------------------------

Main Flask tutorial by [Michael Herman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLjmbh6XPGK4ISY747FUHXEl9lBxre4mM) at [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)

A simple Flask web application tutorial - a first try-out.

In this tutorial I will also be attempting to utilize a Docker container, not
part of the Flask tut, but guidance taken from other sources.

Some of the code has departed a little from the tutorial as I try to
make it a bit 'individual'.

In addintion to the tutorial material, I will be also try to
containerize this app - Docker. This part has as yet not been added.
